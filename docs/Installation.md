# Installation

## Binaries

This is the simplest method for installing CLI. Binaries for Wordfence CLI can be downloaded on the Releases page of the GitHub repository (under Assets of each release) along with source code, and the .whl files:

[https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/releases](https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/releases)

The binary files are in the format `wordfence_x.x.x_yyyy_linux_exec.tar.gz` where `x.x.x` is the Wordfence CLI version, and `yyyy` is the CPU architecture. The following example uses `1.0.0` as the version, and `AMD64` as the architecture. 

We recommend verifying the authenticity of the download prior to extracting the archive. You can do this by following [the steps outlined below](#verifying-the-authenticity-of-a-release-asset) prior to following the rest of these installation steps. 

Extract the binary:

	tar xvzf wordfence_1.0.0_amd64_linux_exec.tar.gz

Verify the binary works correctly on your system:

	./wordfence scan --version

You should see output similar to this:

	Wordfence CLI 1.0.0

Once this is done, we recommend [reviewing the configuration](Configuration.md) to go through configuring a license followed by [running your first scan](Examples.md).

## `pip` Installation of the Wheel Archive File

The wheel archive file (`.whl`) for Wordfence CLI can be downloaded on the Releases page of the GitHub repository (under Assets of each release). For more information on installation of wheel archive files for Python, see the [pip documentation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#installing-from-wheels "User Guide - pip documentation"). 

The .whl archive is in the format `wordfence-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl` where `x.x.x` is the Wordfence CLI version. The following example uses `1.0.0` as the version. Select the .whl file from the Releases page:

[https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/releases](https://github.com/wordfence/wordfence-cli/releases)

We recommend verifying the authenticity of the download prior to extracting the archive. You can do this by following [the steps outlined below](#verifying-the-authenticity-of-a-release-asset) prior to following the rest of these installation steps. 

Install the archive using `pip`:

	pip install wordfence-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl 

This should install an executable of Wordfence CLI at the following directory when installed as the `username` user:

	/home/username/.local/bin/wordfence

If run as root, the executable path should be:

	/usr/local/bin/wordfence

Verify the executable works correctly on your system:

	./wordfence scan --version

You should see output similar to this:

	Wordfence CLI 1.0.0

Once this is done, we recommend [reviewing the configuration](Configuration.md) to go through configuring a license followed by [running your first scan](Examples.md).

## Docker

To install Wordfence CLI using Docker, you can clone the GitHub repo to your local environment:

	git clone git@github.com:wordfence/wordfence-cli.git
	cd ./wordfence-cli
	docker build -t wordfence-cli:latest .

Once the Docker image is built, you can start the docker container with the volumes you wish to scan:

	docker run -v /var/www:/var/www wordfence-cli:latest scan --version

You should see output similar to this:

	Wordfence CLI 1.0.0

Once this is done, we recommend [reviewing the configuration](Configuration.md) to go through configuring a license followed by [running your first scan](Examples.md).

## Manual Installation

To install Wordfence CLI manually, you can clone the GitHub repo to your local environment:

	git clone git@github.com:wordfence/wordfence-cli.git
	cd ./wordfence-cli
	pip install .
	python main.py scan --version

You can additionally build the wheel archive and generate an executable:
	
	pip install build~=0.10
	python -m build --wheel
	pip install dist/wordfence-*.whl

The executable should be installed to `~/.local/bin/wordfence`.

If you encounter an error about `libpcre.so` similar to this one:

	OSError: libpcre.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You may need to install the `libpcre` library. 

## Verifying the Authenticity of a Release Asset

Each of our downloadable release assets are signed using GPG as a part of the build process. We recommend verifying the authenticity of these downloads prior to extracting and executing any code. This example below uses the Wordfence CLI source code archive file, but the process is the same for any of the release assets. You can find our public key used to verify the signatures here:

	https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/public.asc
	
To verify a signed binary, download both the gzipped binary and the .asc armor file.

	wget https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/public.asc
	gpg --import public.asc

You can optionally sign the public key with your own private key:

	gpg --lsign-key 00B225C7030F26FF4A3D3481F82623ECE1DB0FBB

Each release asset has a .asc armor file that should be downloaded in addition to the asset. To verify the download run the following code (replace the file names with the ones you've downloaded):

	gpg --assert-signer 00B225C7030F26FF4A3D3481F82623ECE1DB0FBB --verify wordfence.tar.gz.asc wordfence.tar.gz

If your version of GPG doesn't include `--assert-signer` you can just run (you may see a warning using this method):

	gpg --verify wordfence_1.0.0_amd64_linux_exec.tar.gz.asc wordfence_1.0.0_amd64_linux_exec.tar.gz

You should see output similar to this:

	gpg: Signature made Fri Aug 18 16:27:11 2023 EDT
	gpg:                using EDDSA key 00B225C7030F26FF4A3D3481F82623ECE1DB0FBB
	gpg:                issuer "opensource@wordfence.com"
	gpg: Good signature from "Wordfence <opensource@wordfence.com>" [ultimate]
	gpg: signer '00B225C7030F26FF4A3D3481F82623ECE1DB0FBB' matched
