# Output

By default Wordfence CLI will print a banner followed by which paths it was supplied for scanning:

	Scanning path: /home/user/

Files found that match a signature matches are printed in the output as well. There are additionally the `--verbose` and `--debug` options that can be used to get further information about what Wordfence CLI is doing under the hood.

## Report Formats

The report is a separate output stream generated by Wordfence CLI that will contain a list of the files detected by one of our signatures. Use `--output-columns` to configure which columns are written to the report. Available columns: `filename`, `signature_id`, `signature_name`, `signature_description`, `matched_text`. 

- CSV (Comma-Separate Values): Tabular formatted file containing file names, and signature details about what was matched.
- TSV (Comma-Separate Values): Tabular formatted file containing file names, and signature details about what was matched.
- NULL-byte delimited: A NULL-byte delimited list of file paths only (does not contain signature or match data).
