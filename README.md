# Wordfence CLI

Wordfence CLI is a multi-process malware scanner written in Python. It's designed to have low memory overhead while being able to utilize multiple cores for scanning large filesystems for malware. Wordfence CLI uses `libpcre` over Python's existing regex libraries for speed and compatibility with our signature set.

## Installation
